# alpine
a fork of the docker alpine linux image

This fork is just the alpine image with the following changes:

 1. patched `env` command to also have the `--null` argument. (useful for CI's that do `env --null`)
 1. patched the dns so the container links work correctly
 1. added `bash` mainly because CI's use it, and its habit
